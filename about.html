        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Ozark the Dog was created to make it easier for people to connect and put pressure on their state senators and representatives. Inspired by Leeja Miller’s video, “Why Aren’t the Democrats Doing Anything?”, this tool was born.</p>
        <p>Why the name Ozark the Dog? Because, like Ozark, who barks relentlessly at every stranger on the other side of the door, refusing to be ignored–you, too, need to make noise and demand action from Congress to help save democracy.</p>
      <p>Let’s be clear: Ozark the Dog stands for LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom, Black Lives Matters, civil rights, immigrants’ rights, freeing Palestine, helping those in need, fighting fascism, and resisting white supremacy.</p>
