        <p>
          Ozark the Dog was created to make it easier for people to connect with
          their state senators and representatives, and hold them accountable.
          Inspired by Leeja Miller’s video,

          Why the name Ozark the Dog? Like Ozark, who barks relentlessly at
          every stranger at the door, refusing to be ignored, this platform
          encourages you to make noise and demand action from Congress to help
          save democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s be clear: Ozark the Dog stands for justice and equality. We
          support LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive freedom, Black Lives Matter, civil
          rights, immigrants’ rights, the liberation of Palestine, and fighting
          fascism and white supremacy.
